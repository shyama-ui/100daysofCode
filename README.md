Basic Python Programming
1.
## Find The Parity Outlier
You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.
2.
## Persistent Bugger
Write a function, persistence, that takes in a positive parameter num and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in num until you reach a single digit.
3.
## Valid Phone Number
Write a function that accepts a string, and returns true if it is in the form of a phone number.
Assume that any integer from 0-9 in any of the spots will produce a valid phone number.
Only worry about the following format:
(123) 456-7890 (don't forget the space after the close parentheses)
